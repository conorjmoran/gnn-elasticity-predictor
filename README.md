# gnn-elasticity-predictor-2
ALIGNN-style GNN for predicting bulk and shear moduli from Materials Project DFT data. Uses a 5-member ensemble, heteroscedastic head, and conformal calibration to quantify epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, accelerating materials discovery by reducing redundant DFT simulations.
